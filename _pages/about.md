I am a PhD candidate in [Department of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics](https://www.ieda.ust.hk/eng/index.php) at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jin Qi](https://www.ieda.ust.hk/eng/faculty-staff.php?catid=5&sid=15&id=22). 

My research interests are in data-driven decision-making and distributionally robust optimization, with applications in healthcare operations management.
